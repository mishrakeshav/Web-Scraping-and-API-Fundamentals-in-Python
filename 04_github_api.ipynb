Ben jij een netwerker en in staat om samen met de politieoperatie kansen om te zetten naar technische oplossingen? Dan zoeken wij jou!</p>\\n<p><strong>Wat ga je doen?</strong></p>\\n<p>Als platform engineer bouw je samen met andere cloud engineers het cloud-platform. Vervolgens beheer je dit platform en zorg je voor de uitbreidingen. Het cloud platform vereist voor het dagelijks beheer niet veel tijd en moeite. De nadruk ligt dan ook op het uitbouwen van de functionaliteit. Denk hierbij aan het uitbreiden van de diensten (tegels) die het platform beschikbaar stelt.</p>\\n<p>Als jij je werk goed doet, doe je hooguit één keer iets handmatig. Als het vaker moet, dan automatiseer je het. Je zorgt ervoor dat het platform veilig is en blijft, terwijl de gebruikers er goed en flexibel gebruik van kunnen maken. Dat doe je door er voor te zorgen dat er (op tijd) gepatched kan worden zonder downtime. Gebruikers van het platform die vragen hebben probeer je altijd verder te helpen. Dit doe je zo efficiënt mogelijk, zodat je tijd overhoudt voor het uitbreiden van de diensten op het platform en daarmee de beschikbare functionaliteit.</p>\\n<p><strong>Waar ga je werken?</strong></p>\\n<p>Het Team High Tech Crime van de Dienst Landelijke Recherche kan op eigen initiatief opsporingsonderzoeken starten op basis van gesignaleerde trends en analyses. \\'Aan de voorkant komen\\' is een belangrijk wapen; wat zijn nieuwe programma\\'s, devices en methodes waarmee we cybercriminelen voor kunnen zijn?

       "  'description': '<p>Senior Research Engineer - ESTCP and MIDAS - (2000298)</p>\\n<p>The Institute for Software Integrated Systems at Vanderbilt University is expanding two of its research teams, ESTCP and MIDAS. Candidates applying to this requisition should be prepared to explain during a phone interview which research team interests them, why, and what qualifications they have that would suit that team.</p>\\n<p>Senior Research Engineers on these teams are responsible for engineering and/or software design, implementation, analysis, and maintenance or experimentation. They assist the Principal Investigator (PI) and System Architect with development and maintenance of discipline-specific software systems and/or engineering tools to support project and research goals through collaboration on a team of Research Engineers and Research Scientists.</p>\\n<p>ESTCP Research Team\\nThe ESTCP team\\'s current project involves transitioning future \"Smart Grid\" management from a centralized to a coordinated and distributed control paradigm, specifically, using an integrated microgrid. Microgrids, with local power generation and storage capability, can greatly reduce dependence on large utilities while providing sufficiently reliable power to communities. However, microgrids need intelligent and distributed control systems to manage various modes of operations and to provide a stable energy supply. This project is developing an open source microgrid control system that runs on a network of small embedded devices attached to the microgrid power system components (photovoltaic cells, batteries, residential loads, etc.) The ultimate goal is to build field-tested, generic control system software that is highly customizable and can be widely used in various microgrid systems.</p>\\n<p>MIDAS Research Team\\nThe MIDAS team\\'s current project involves developing a new approach to evolutionary software development and deployment that extends the results of model-based software engineering. The project will construct an integrated, end-to-end framework for building software that is focused on growth and adaptation. The envisioned technology is based on the concept of a ‘Model Design Language’ (MDL) that supports the expression of the developer’s objectives (the ‘what’), intentions (the ‘how’), and constraints (the ‘limitations’) related to the software artifacts to be produced. The ‘models’ represented in this language are called the ‘design models’ for the software artifact(s) and they encompass more than what we express today in software models like UML. We consider software development as a continuous process, as in the DevOps paradigm, where the software is undergoing continuous change, improvement, and extension; and our goal is to build the tools to support this. The main idea is that changes in the requirements will result in the designer/developer making changes in the ‘design model’ that will result in automatically generated changes in the generated artifacts, or changes in the target system, at run-time, as needed.</p>\\n<p>Duties and Responsibilities</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Assist with modeling and analysis of discipline-specific engineering problems.</li>\\n<li>Assist PI and/or System Architect with the development and maintenance of discipline-specific software systems and/or engineering tools to support project and research goals.</li>\\n<li>Perform engineering and/or software design, implementation, analysis, maintenance, or experimentation as directed by PI and lead Engineers.</li>\\n<li>Adhere to existing technical standards and recommend or develop new standards, as applicable.</li>\\n<li>Prepare technical documentation for work products of project.</li>\\n<li>Maintain familiarity with and expertise in emerging technologies and techniques related to project and research goals.</li>\\n<li>Provide PI and /or System Architect with accurate documentation of all systems within project research area of direct involvement or responsibility.</li>\\n<li>Provide PI and/or System Architect with data to assist in evaluation of project research direction and progress, providing input on solutions as necessary.</li>\\n<li>Provide PI and /or System Architect with daily documentation of work performed.</li>\\n<li>Effectively deliver technical progress reports and presentations in written and oral forms to project research staff and faculty.</li>\\n<li>Communicate regularly, effectively, and professionally with PI, System Architect, and research team.</li>\\n<li>Share research knowledge, product, and processes with PI, System Architect, and research team.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Profile of an Ideal Candidate</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>A Bachelor’s Degree in computer science or engineering is necessary.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>The following skills are necessary:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Solid, established skills in software system development, modeling, and/or systems engineering.</li>\\n<li>Ability to design, implement, test, document, and maintain software.</li>\\n<li>Practical knowledge of software development tools, programming languages (e.g., C/C++, Java, Python, Matlab, C#, among others), databases, and web technologies, as needed by project.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>The following skills are a plus:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Experience with the development of embedded systems.</li>\\n<li>Knowledge of basics of machine learning techniques.</li>\\n<li>Familiarity with the concepts of autonomy and autonomous cyber-physical systems.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Commitment to Equity, Diversity and Inclusion\\nVanderbilt University is committed to achieving the goal of a diverse and inclusive academic community of faculty, staff, and students.

       "  'description': '<h2>Hi,</h2>\\n<p>we are the place search squad at moovel, and we work on the place search engine used by all moovel apps. Users engage with place search as the first step of their transit journey. Our job is to help them find what they are looking for with the least amount of effort on their part. Specifically, if a user types a bunch of characters into a search field, we analyze their input using textual analysis, user and place contexts, distance, popularity, etc, in order to have their intended location displayed at the first rank. This is no easy task and is perhaps the reason why most companies opt for an off the shelf SaaS offering to provide a place search. We dislike black boxes and find these kinds of challenges exciting! This also gives us the freedom to innovate and develop a highly integrated and specialized search experience for our use cases.</p>\\n<h2>First a quick look at us</h2>\\n<p>The topic of mobility is evolving at a startling pace. Fundamentals are being questioned, new ways of getting around are emerging and challenging the established ones. At Moovel (becomes REACH NOW), we aim to take part in shaping that future. Software is eating the world and mobility is certainly no exception. Ultimately, we want to help cities become smarter by building on the operational wisdom of city administrations and mobility service providers. We don’t want to disrupt but augment the means of getting around by employing contemporary technologies.</p>\\n<p>The problems we are engaging in are manifold and from the real world. Our solutions do not only have an impact on a single industry branch but also aim to transform the city. They involve fields like routing, searching, AI, innovative UX and much more. Things are very dynamic in the mobility space and thus we devote ourselves to a lot of exploratory work.</p>\\n<h2>About the team</h2>\\n<p>The place search squad is a small engineering team dedicated to place search. We enjoy a high degree of autonomy, trust and responsibility. We value pragmatism, simplicity and collaboration. We have an open feedback and failure culture, because we know that both are necessary to find proper solutions. We embrace agile in a non-dogmatic fashion.</p>\\n<p>Teams at moovel choose the tools they regard as the best fit for their problems, at their discretion. Hence the technology stack is rather diverse. We employ a microservice backend architecture based on Docker and AWS. Cloud Services are leveraged wherever they help us to focus on our task. We practice continuous delivery and value DevOps culture (you build it, you run it).</p>\\n<h2>Some of the things you will do</h2>\\n<p>Research and optimize search results using information retrieval tools such as Elasticsearch and methods such as natural language processing (NLP), learning to rank (LTR), and Bayesian hyperparameter optimization (HPO).</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Build large-scale microservices and product integrations.</li>\\n<li>Work on our data import pipeline.</li>\\n<li>Assess and remedy search and data quality issues.</li>\\n<li>Discover insights through exploratory data analysis to improve search performance.</li>\\n<li>Develop new ways to learn from our real-world users.</li>\\n<li>Develop a machine learning infrastructure and platform.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>Your skill set</h2>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Experience in Node.js, Python, or similar stacks.</li>\\n<li>Experience with information retrieval, ranking systems, recommendation systems or artificial intelligence.</li>\\n<li>Familiarity with Lucene and Elasticsearch / Solr.</li>\\n<li>Familiarity with AWS or other cloud technologies.</li>\\n<li>Fluency in Business English is mandatory.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>Benefits</h2>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Choose your own hardware</li>\\n<li>Working with newest technologies &amp; microservices</li>\\n<li>Be part of an interdisciplinary team of experts</li>\\n<li>Working on products with a high impact on society</li>\\n<li>International teams</li>\\n<li>Flexible working hours</li>\\n<li>Weekly breakfast, good coffee &amp; fresh fruits</li>\\n<li>Monthly mobility budget</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>If this caught your attention, then we can not wait to meet you soon!

We\\'re essentially running a distributed system that has lots of moving parts and having a decent amount of experience with this type of system helps a lot!</p>\\n<p>Additionally, our apps have over 5000 daily active users with sessions longer than 6h/day and tens of millions of end consumers per year. That is why we put great importance on quality, testing, and code-review of all our code. Our apps have big codebases, and we have to feel comfortable about navigating and progressively improving them. Sometimes, however, we gotta get dirty and figure out why the DB is slow or why some k8s pod is not running correctly, figure out how to successfully retry a failing API request, etc…</p>\\n<p><em>We have two openings available, one for both offices: Paris (France) and San Francisco (USA).</em></p>\\n<p><strong>What You’ll Do</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Making our React and React Native applications gorgeous and progressively improving them</li>\\n<li>Scaling and maintaining our chat application that serves millions of concurrent users</li>\\n<li>Fixing bugs, updating/refactoring the existing apps</li>\\n<li>There\\'s still lots of stuff to improve</li>\\n<li>And more…</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>About You</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>1+ years of experience developing web applications</li>\\n<li>3+ years of experience doing back-end development with Python</li>\\n<li>3+ years of experience doing front-end development with JavaScript</li>\\n<li>You are eager to solve unique e-commerce problems</li>\\n<li>You are passionate about learning, and want to help us learn too</li>\\n<li>You care about working on applications that are putting the customer needs first</li>\\n<li>You are comfortable communicating with other technical teams and management to collect requirements, describe software product features, demo work in progress and provide project updates</li>\\n<li>You have the drive and focus to get challenging projects over the finish line, and you are comfortable advocating for what you need to do your best work</li>\\n<li>You thrive in a fast-paced environment</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>Nice to Have</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Experience in designing API/microservices is a huge plus</li>\\n<li>Experience with large-scale e-commerce</li>\\n<li>Experience with high-traffic web applications</li>\\n<li>Experience with agile tools like GitHub</li>\\n<li>Understanding of HTTP and Websockets</li>\\n<li>Experience working directly with DOM, CSS</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>Company Perks &amp; Benefits</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Competitive salary, equity packages and performance bonus packages</li>\\n<li>4 weeks vacation and parental leave</li>\\n<li>Latest MacBook Pro or equivalent</li>\\n<li>Natural sunlight and open office with lounge area</li>\\n<li>Walking distance from Bart (6-10 minutes)</li>\\n<li>Visa sponsorship and relocation expenses</li>\\n<li>Catered lunch 5x per week (rooftop access)</li>\\n<li>Retirement benefits</li>\\n<li>Unlimited snacks</li>\\n<li>Health coverage</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>Useful Things to Know About Gorgias</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\"techcrunch.com/2019/11/26/gorgias-series-a\">Raised our Series A in November</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\"apps.shopify.com/helpdesk#reviews\">What our customers are saying</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\"stackshare.io/gorgias\">Our software stack</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\"jobs.lever.co/gorgias\">Other positions</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>Engineering Team Culture</strong></p>\\n<p>Getting Stuff Done, Ownership, Team Work, Excellence, and Agility.</p>\\n<p>You should join us if you want to ship stuff fast without scarifying quality.

       "  'description': '<h3>About Triplebyte</h3>\\n<p>Triplebyte is transforming the way software engineers are hired. Our mission is to build an open, valuable and skills-based credential for all engineers. This is important because millions of people have skills (and deserve good jobs), but don’t fit the profile that recruiters seek. Another way of saying this is that talent is uniformly distributed, but opportunity is not. Our goal is to broaden the distribution of opportunity.</p>\\n<p>To do this, we have built a background-blind technical assessment and interview process, and we use it to find engineers and help them get jobs at 450+ top companies. Our rich understanding of candidates’ skills and propriety machine learning models enable us to find the right match between our candidates and partner companies. This is why companies like Apple, Dropbox and American Express trust Triplebyte’s technical assessment to identify the best engineers for their open roles and reduce the time and effort it takes to hire them.</p>\\n<p>We just raised a $35 million Series B and our team of 65 is growing quickly! Now is a great time to join as we\\'re on an exciting growth trajectory. You will have lots of opportunities for taking on responsibility and developing new skills quickly.</p>\\n<p>We\\'re an experienced team, the founders have each built and sold companies before. Ammon and Guillaume founded Socialcam (acquired by Autodesk for $60 million) and Harj was the first partner hired at Y Combinator since its founding.</p>\\n<p>We are rapidly growing our engineering team, we are looking for generalist, full-stack, frontend, backend, machine learning, and dev-ops engineers!</p>\\n<h3>Building the best product</h3>\\n<p>The Triplebyte engineering team is still rather small, only 8 people. We all went through the Triplebyte process :)\\nWe move fast, release new features daily and iterate quickly.\\nTriplebyte is growing very quickly and the engineering team is fully dedicated to supporting that growth, in any way we can.\\nWe are a generalist engineering team, we work on anything that helps the company or other teams grow. We cycle through backend, full-stack and frontend work based on the most critical needs. All of us are encouraged to work on all those parts.</p>\\n<p>Our frontend is mostly in React/Redux.\\nOur backend is in Ruby on Rails, Postgres and Redis. (We also use python with Tensorflow for all our data science work)</p>\\n<p>It doesn\\'t seem like it, but we have built a LOT of software. We are a truly full-stack company and we are building a process that needs to be perfect ends to ends. We have software for engineers, for interviewers, for writers, for companies, for us, etc..\\nIf that\\'s any indication of scale, we crossed recently the 200 tables in our Postgres database :)</p>\\n<p>Join us and help us build the best product! We value initiative, productivity, and ownership.</p>\\n<h3>Compensation and Benefits</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Competitive salary and stock options package</li>\\n<li>Open vacation policy</li>\\n<li>Employer paid health, vision and dental insurance</li>\\n<li>401(k) plan with matching</li>\\n<li>Pre-tax commuter benefits</li>\\n<li>Daily catered lunches</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Our Mission</h3>\\n<p>We believe strongly in building a truly meritocratic, unbiased process for finding great talent. Even the best technology companies today still use where people went to college as a proxy for intelligence and ability. We\\'re building a process that looks only at ability, not credentials, so we can have a future where everyone can focus on just learning and being good at what they do, not how they look on paper.</p>\\n<p>Every aspect of running a company has been improved over the last decade, except hiring. Most decisions are still made using amorphous terms like \"gut feel\" or \"culture fit\". They should be made using crisp data. Only a company specializing on this problem, using data collected from the hiring process at hundreds of companies, can solve it. That\\'s the company we\\'re building. Our mission is creating a scientific method for identifying great talent and intelligently routing it to the best place. Starting with software engineers.</p>\\n<p>The Company is an equal opportunity employer and makes employment decisions on the basis of merit and business needs. The Company does not discriminate against employees or applicants (in any aspect of employment, including, but not limited to recruiting and hiring, job assignment, compensation, opportunities for advancement, promotion, transfers, evaluation, benefits, training, discipline, and termination), on the basis of any characteristic protected under applicable federal, state, or local laws.</p>\\n',\n",

Het CBS levert als hét statistische bureau van Nederland met betrouwbare statistische informatie en data inzicht in maatschappelijke vraagstukken. Daarmee voedt het CBS het maatschappelijk debat, de beleidsontwikkeling en de besluitvorming en draagt zo bij aan welvaart, welzijn en democratie.</p>\\n<p>Het CBS werd in 1899 opgericht vanuit de behoefte aan onafhankelijke, betrouwbare informatie om maatschappelijke vraagstukken te begrijpen. Deze rol heeft het CBS nog altijd. De organisatie is inmiddels uitgegroeid tot een innovatieve kennisorganisatie, die voortdurend nieuwe technologieën en ontwikkelingen toepast om de kwaliteit van de gegevens en de onafhankelijke positie te kunnen blijven borgen.</p>\\n<h2><strong>Wat ga je doen?</strong></h2>\\n<p>Je werkt aan het ambitieuze innovatieve product Information Dialogue dat alle statistische informatie van het CBS via toepassing van AI ontsluit, zodat een gebruiker precies díe informatie krijgt die hij nodig heeft. Dit doen we door een computergestuurde dialoog, zo menselijk mogelijk, te ontwikkelen die alle informatie die nu in onze open data database beschikbaar is aan te bieden. We zijn het eerste statistiekbureau in de wereld dat deze uitdaging aangaat.\\nJe gaat de software ontwikkelen die de verbinding maakt tussen deze open data en de spraakrobot (bijvoorbeeld Google Assistant).\\nVoor een impressie waaraan je gaat werken klik hier</p>\\n<h2><strong>Wie zoeken wij</strong></h2>\\n<p>Je bent een Software Engineer met kennis van C#, node.js en Xamarin waarbij kennis van AI-bots zoals Google Dialogflow (Assistent), Cortana, Alexa of Siri een pré is.

Je bent analytisch, creatief, denkt in oplossingen, leert snel, bent een pionier en kan ingewikkelde materie op aansprekende wijze uitleggen aan collega’s die minder van techniek weten. Daarnaast ben je bekend met de principes van Agile en Scrum. Uiteraard heb je uitstekende samenwerkingsvaardigheden.</p>\\n<h2><strong>Waar kom je te werken</strong></h2>\\n<p>Je komt te werken in een jong agile team dat verantwoordelijk is voor ontwikkeling van de Information Dialogue, één van de cutting edge innovaties die er voor zorgen dat het CBS tot één van de beste en meest vooruitstrevende statistiekbureaus ter wereld blijft behoren. De sfeer van dit team is die van een Start-up, met hoge ambities, grote uitdagingen en de gedrevenheid om de Information Dialogue tot een succes te maken.</p>\\n<h2><strong>Aanbod</strong></h2>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Een salaris van minimaal €2631 en maximaal €4809 bruto per maand op basis van 36 uur.
